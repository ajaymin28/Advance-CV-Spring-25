## 📚 Notebooks

### 1. 🚀 Introduction to PyTorch & Hugging Face
A foundational notebook to get started with:
- PyTorch, CLIP inference for Zero shot image capation classification
- Using Hugging Face `transformers`
- Vision transformer models
- Performing inference using pre-trained vision-language models

---

### 2. 🖼️ BLIP for Image Captioning & Visual Question Answering
Explore **BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining)**, a powerful model for multimodal tasks:
- Generate image captions  
- Answer visual questions  
- Analyze model outputs and limitations

---

### 3. 🧪 Visual Large Language Models on Platinum Benchmark
Evaluate state-of-the-art **VLLMs** (Visual Large Language Models) on the **Platinum benchmark**:
- Test vision-language reasoning abilities  
- Explore model performance on complex visual prompts  
- Analyze results and qualitative outputs

---

### 4. 💨 Diffusion Models & Human Redaction
Hands-on experimentation with diffusion models and visual privacy:
- Learn how diffusion models generate images  
- Implement human redaction/anonymization techniques  
- Discuss ethical and privacy-related implications
